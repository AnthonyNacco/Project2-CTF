# Project2-CTF
Capture the Flag exploitations
This is the second project that I completed in the Bootcamp. This project was a capture the flag scenario in which I searched for and exploited multiple vulnerabilities in a web application, Linux Server, and Windows Server using vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting, PHP Injection, SQL Injection, and others. 
This Project also showcases my use of scanning tools such as Nmap, dirb, Nessus, Metasploit, and others
This project is a work in progress and will be updated as I complete more.
